The ACM REP evolved from the International Workshop on Practical Reproducible Evaluation of Computer Systems (P-RECS) which was started by [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/), [Carlos Maltzahn](https://people.ucsc.edu/carlosm), and [Jay Lofstead](http://lofstead.org/) in [2018](https://p-recs.github.io/2018/) in cooperation with ACM SIGHPC, co-located with the International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC), and followed by four editions in [2019](https://p-recs.github.io/2019/), [2020](https://p-recs.github.io/2020/), [2021](https://p-recs.github.io/2021/), and [2022](https://p-recs.github.io/2022/), all co-located with HPDC. Since 2019 P-RECS was the annual forum for the [ACM Emerging Interest Group for Reproducibility and Independent Verification](https://reproducibility.acm.org/) (EIGREP). In 2023 P-RECS merged into ACM REP as part of the effort of advancing EIGREP to a Special Interest Group (SIGREP).
